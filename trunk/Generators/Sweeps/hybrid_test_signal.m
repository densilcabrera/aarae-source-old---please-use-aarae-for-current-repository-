function OUT = hybrid_test_signal
% This function generates a sequence of test signals from some of AARAE's
% generators, which can be analysed to yield an impulse response using
% AARAE's Hybrid_process processor.
%
% You can use variations of the one signal type and/or a variety of signals
% to generate the one impulse response.
%
% By combining a variety of test signals into a single measurement your
% can: 
% * explore the variation between the IR results from each;
% * manage signal-to-noise ratio by combining the IRs (e.g. using average
% or median)
