function OUT = STIdirect_signal(duration, fs, octavebandlevel, silenceduration, STImethod)
% Generates a signal for STI direct measurement (direct method) based to IEC
% 60268-16 (2011). 
% Either of three approaches can be taken:
% STImethod = 0:
%   generate seven STIPA-like signals that populate the entire 98-value MTF
%   matrix. This is a faster method.
% STImethod = 1:
%   generate seven pairs of synchronously double-modulated signals - like
%   STIPA, but with the same modulation frequency pairs in each octave band.
%   This takes the same amount of time as the first method, but is probably
%   easier to understand and provides a direct experience of what is meant
%   by modulation transfer function.
% STImethod = 2:
%   generate fourteen moduated signals that populate the entire 98-value
%   MTF matrix one modulation frequency at a time. This is the slower
%   method, but it is easier to understand, and probably closer to the
%   intention of IEC 60268-16. It provides a direct experience of what is
%   meant by modulation transfer function.
%
% The duration of each signal should normally be 20 s or longer (longer
% durations normally yield more accurate results), and the default duration
% is 30 s. 
%
% The seven or 14 signals are separated by a gap of 1 s by default, but a
% longer gap may be helpful in reverberant conditions.
%
% Equalization and calibration is required to use this properly (in the same
% way as for STIPA measurements).
%
% Analysis of the generated and re-recorded signals should be done using
% AARAE's STI_direct analyser (in the Speech folder). This analyser
% automatically detects which type of signal was generated (from the
% 'properties' data) and analyses it accordingly. Note that you may use the
% original signal as a reference signal as part of the analysis, and this
% should reduce (or ideally remove) the random influence of the noise in
% the analysis (although it is does not strictly follow IEC 60268-16)
