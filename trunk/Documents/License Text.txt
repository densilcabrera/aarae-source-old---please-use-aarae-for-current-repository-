AARAE uses the BSD 3-Clause license for the project as a whole, and
therefore  contributed code within the project should preferably use 
it to minimise license conflicts.

When you prepare a Matlab file for incorporation into AARAE, please 
add the following license to any code that you contribute. 
You need only to copy the text and paste it as a comment in your
file, and change the <YEAR>, <OWNER> (both on the first line) fields and 
the <ORGANISATION> field (clause 3) to what they should be.

In cases of collaboratively written code, there can be multiple owners.
For further information, refer initially to:
http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause



Below is the BSD-3-Clause license prepared for insertion as a Matlab
comment.
