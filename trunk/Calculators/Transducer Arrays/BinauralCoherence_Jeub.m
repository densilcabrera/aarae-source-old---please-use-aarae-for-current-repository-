function OUT = BinauralCoherence_Jeub
% This function ports Marco Jeub's Binaural Coherence of Noise Fields
% calculator to AARAE. The following is a quote from the Matlab file
% exchange site:
%
% A Matlab reference implementation of a novel semi-analytical signal
% processing model for the binaural coherence of homogeneous isotropic
% noise fields is presented.
%
% The model is derived from a simplified geometrical model of the human head,
% where the shadowing between the left and right ear is modeled by two
% non-reflecting circular plates. Based on Kirchhoff?s diffraction theory,
% it is shown how the corresponding coherence is calculated. This model can
% be used as part of various binaural signal processing algorithms, such as
% speech enhancement for digital hearing aids or binaural speech
% transmission systems. In experiments using an artificial head in a highly
% reverberant environment, it is confirmed that the proposed theoretical
% model shows a good match with the coherence obtained from measurements.
%
% Within this implmentation, arbitrary dimensions for head and microphone
% distances can be employed and no acoustic measurements are required.
