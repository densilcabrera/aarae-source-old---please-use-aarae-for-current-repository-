AARAE - Audio and Acoustical Response Analysis Environment for MATLAB

In order to start AARAE, please make the AARAE folder your 'Current folder'
in the MATLAB path. You should find all the AARAE subfolders:

    - Analysers
    - Audio
    - Calculators
    - Documents
    - Framework
    - Generators
    - Processors
    - Projects
    - Templates
    - Utilities

These folders do not need to be added to the MATLAB path in order for the
GUI interface to launch.
You should also find the aarae.m and aarae.fig files in your current
directory. This will automatically appear as part of the current
directory's available files, along with the Licence for AARAE and this
README.txt file.

Once you've made the AARAE folder your current folder in the MATLAB path,
in order to launch AARAE, please type in MATLAB's Command Window:

>> aarae

This command will launch the user interface for AARAE.

We hope you find this project useful and we would highly appreciate your
valuable feedback.
