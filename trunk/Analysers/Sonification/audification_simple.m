function out = audification_simple(in)
% Provides a simple framework for audification of input audio
%
% Audification means 'playing data as if it is sound'. When we audify an
% audio waveform, this can be as trivial as playing it. However, it is also
% possible to do some simple transformations of the audio data so that
% certain features become more audible.
%
% Common transformations that are used in audification include:
% * filtering
% * speeding up or slowing down the wave (resampling it);
% * time-reversing the waveform;
% * doing envelope manipulations;
% * doing spectrum manipulations;

%
% ABOUT THE SETTINGS
% The default values result in no change in the audio
%
% A high-pass and/or low-pass filter can be applied. The specified
% frequencies refer to the original file (prior to resampling if that is
% done). Filtering is done via fft.
%
% Speed-up (resampling) factor may be used to speed up or slow down the
% audio data. A value of 2 doubles the speed (with a +1 octave frequency
% shift). A value of 0.5 halves the speed (with a -1 octave frequency
% shift).
%
% Time reversal can be set (1) or clear (0, meaning no change).
%
% The envelope dynamic contrast exponent controls the time envelope of the
% audio (via the Hilbert transform):
%   1 creates no change
%   A larger number (e.g. 1) increases dynamic contrast)
%   0 creates a constant envelope (no dynamic contrast)
%   A negative value inverts the dynamic contrast.
%
% The envelope smoothing filter length is the length (in samples) of a
% filter used to smooth the envelope function. It should be a positive
% integer. A value of 1 creates no smoothing.
%
% The spectrum dynamic contrast exponent acts similarly to the envelope
% dynamic contrast exponent, except that it is applied to the spectrum.
%   1 creates no change
%   A greater number (e.g. 2) increases dynamic contrast in the spectrum)
%   0 creates a constant magnitude spectrum (no dynamic contrast)
%   A negative value inverts the magnitude spectrum.
%
% The spectrum smoothign filter works in the same way as the envelope
% smoothing filter, except that it is applied to the spectrum magnitude.
