function out = binaural_simple(in, fs, f_low, f_high, t_start, t_end)
% This function calculates parameters from binaural impulse response
% measurements.
%
% You can use it to analyse the direct sound of binaural impulse
% responses if you want to know the ITD and ILD over particular frequency
% ranges. These should indicate what direction the sound comes from, in
% terms of lateralization.
%
% When you analyse longer portions of binaural impulse responses (e.g., 50
% ms or 80 ms), the interaural cross correlation function is likely to be
% of interest (including the IACC value, which is used to indicate the
% 'apparent source width' or spaciousness of the sound). A value close to 1
% indicates that the sound mainly comes from 1 direction, whereas a value
% close to 0 indicates that the sound is spread out in space.
%
% You can filter the binaural impulse response by specifying values of
% f_low and f_high (these must be between 0 Hz and the Nyquist frequency).
% If you omit these input arguments, then no filtering is done. When they
% are included, filtering is performed in the frequency domain by zeroing
% the spectrum components outside of the specified range. Filtering affects
% most of the output arguments (IACC, ITD, IACF, ILD, Level) and the IACF plot.
% It does not affect the plots of the wave, envelope and spectrum nor the
% Levelspectrum and frequencies output arguments.
%
% This function does not aim to replicate standard IACC methods, but
% instead is intended as an exploratory tool. It is not suitable for
% analysing binaural impulse responses filtered into multiple bands.

% INPUT ARGUMENTS
% wave is two channels of audio (a binaural impulse response). This
% function will crash if you input 1 channel!
% f_low is the lower cut-off frequency of a bandpass filter in Hz.
% f_high is the upper cut-off frequency of a bandpass filter in Hz.
% f_high must be greater than f_low, and you should consider the frequency
% resolution of the fft in choosing these values.
% fs is the audio sampling rate in Hz.
%
% OUTPUT ARGUMENTS
% IACC is the interaural cross correlation coefficient of the filtered
% spectrum.
% ITD is the interaural time difference of the filtered spectrum in ms.
% IACF is the interaural cross correlation function (sampling rate is fs).
% ILD is the interaural level difference of the filtered spectrum, in dB.
% Level is the level in dB of each channel (after filtering). Note that
% this is an energy level, rather than a power level - i.e. it will
% increase with the duration of the input wave.
% Levelspectrum is the magnitude spectrum of each channel expressed in dB.
% frequencies is a vector with the frequencies pertaining to Levelspectrum
