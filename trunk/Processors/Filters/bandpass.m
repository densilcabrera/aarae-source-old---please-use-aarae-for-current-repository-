function OUT = bandpass(IN, flo, fhi, orderout, fs)
% This function applies a zero phase bandpass filter in the frequency
% domain to the input audio.
%
% The high and low frequency cutoff frequencies can be specified, which
% should be in the range between 0 Hz and the Nyquist frequency, and the
% high cutoff frequency should be greater than the low cutoff frequency.
%
% The filter response at cutoff frequency is -3 dB.
%
% The filter pseudo-order is used to shape the magnitude response - such
% that the filter skirt slopes are 6n per octave (n being the filter
% pseudo-order). The default filter order of 24 yields a slope of 144
% dB/octave. However, if the band limits are close to the 0 Hz or Nyquist
% frequencies (and the audio input is brief), then this slope might not be
% realized in practice.
%
% The 0 Hz component is always zeroed by this function.
