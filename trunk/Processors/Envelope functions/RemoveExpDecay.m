function [OUT, varargout] = RemoveExpDecay(IN, fs, start_time, end_time)
% This function calculates the exponential decay rate of an input audio
% wave (e.g. a room impulse response) and compensates for it.
%
% The decay rate is calculated over the time period between the 'start time'
% and 'end time', and then the whole wave is adjusted accordingly. It may
% be useful to view the waveform using decibels (level) to help decide
% on the values of start and end times.
%
% The decay rate is expressed as an equivalent reverberation time, which is
% displayed in Matlab's Command Window.
%
% This function works with multiple channels and multiple bands.
%
% It can be used to listen to how the spectrum of a room impulse response
% evolves over time.
