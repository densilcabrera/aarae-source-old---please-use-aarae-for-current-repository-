% function [azim,elev] = RegularPolyhedron(nbPoints,i)
%
% Angular positions of 3D regular and pseudo-regular polyhedra summits, 
% for a given number of summits. Available numbers of summits are:
% -   4 (tetrahedron)
% -   6 (hexahedron)
% -   8 (octahedron)
% -  12 (icosahedron)
% -  14 (cube-octahedron compound)
% -  20 (dodecahedron)
% -  24 (i=1, small rhombicuboctahedron ; i=2, snub cube ; 
%        i=3, modified small rhombicuboctahedron )
% -  32 (dodecahedron-icosahedron compound)
% -  60 (truncated icosahedron a.k.a. bucky/soccer ball)
% -  92 (truncated icosahedron - dodecahedron-icosahedron-compound compound)
% - 162 (triangulation-refined icosahedron)
% - 642 (triangulation-refined triangulation-refined icosahedron
%
% Note: i is an optional argument, which is taken into account only when
% there is more than one possible polyhedron for nbPoints. Its default
% value is 1.
