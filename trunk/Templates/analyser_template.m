function [OUT varargout] = analyser_template(IN, input_1, input_2)
% This function can be used as a template for adapting your audio
% analysing functions to work in the AARAE environment.
%
% AARAE analysers take the audio information stored in the AARAE tree
% display and process the input to produce an output. Unlike generator and
% calculator functions in AARAE, analyser functions require an input in
% the form of a structure type variable (IN) and will output a structure
% type variable with the analysis result (OUT). The input structure will
% ALWAYS have at least the fields .audio, .fs and .datatype that you can
% use to analyse the audio. Analysers may as well include additional
% fields to the output structure in the .properies field (structure type)
%
% You can also use these first few lines to write a brief description of
% what your function does. This will be displayed as a tooltip when the
% user hoovers the mouse over the box where your function is displayed in
% AARAE
%
% The next few lines show an example on how you may use MATLAB's built-in
% inputdlg function to allow the user to type in the input arguments your
% function requires to work.

if nargin ==1 % If the function is called within the AARAE environment it
              % will have at least one input parameter which is the audio
              % data structure that your function will process, therefore
              % you can check that the user has input all input parameters
              % if you want your function to work as standalone outside the
              % AARAE environment. You can use this input dialog to request
              % for the additional parameters that you require for your
              % function to work if they're not part of the AARAE structure

    param = inputdlg({'Input 1';... % These are the input box titles in the
                      'Input 2'},...% inputdlg window.

                      ...        % input box and the number of character
                      ...        % spaces that each box can display at once
                      ...        % per row.
                      {'2';'3'}); % And the preset answers for your dialog.

                                  % good idea to turn strings into numbers.

    % If the requirements are met, your code can be executed!
    % You may copy and paste some code you've written or write something

    audio = flipud(audio);
    duration = length(audio)/fs;
    maximum = max(audio);
    minimum = min(audio);
    % You may include tables to display your results using AARAE's
    % disptables.m function, this is just an easy way to display the
    % built-in uitable function in MATLAB

                'ColumnName',{'Duration','Maximum','Minimum'},...
                'RowName',{'Results'});
    disptables(fig1,table1);
    % You may want to display your tables as barplots in teh AARAE
    % environment, in order to do this simply use the output of the
    % disptables funtion as follows:
    %       [~,table] = disptables(fig1,table1);
    % And include your table in the output data structure
    %       OUT.tables = table;
    % If you have multiple tables to combine in the figure, you can
    % concatenate them:
    % 
    %       disptables(fig1,[table1 table2 table3]);
    % 
    % You may export these tables to be displayed as bar plots as if you
    % were doing it for a single table:
    %       [~,tables] = disptables(fig1,[table1 table2 table3]);
    %       OUT.tables = tables;
    % The disptables function will take care of allocating each table to a
    % different barplot, there is no need to generate more than one .tables
    % field to display all your tables.
    
    % You may also include figures to display your results as plots.

    % All figures created by your function are stored in the AARAE
    % environment under the results box. If your function outputs a
    % structure in OUT this saved under the 'Results' branch in AARAE and
    % it's treated as an audio signal if it has both .audio and .fs fields,
    % otherwise it's displayed as data.
    % You may want to include your plots as part of the data variable
    % generated by AARAE, in order to do this use the getplotdata function
    % as follows:
    %       OUT.lines.myplot = getplotdata;
    % Use this function for as many charts as you want to include as output
    % from your function. Remember to call the getplotdata function after
    % you have designed your chart. Currently this function only supports
    % barplots and lines. E.g.:
    % 
    %       plot(t,audio)
    %       OUT.lines.thischart = getplotdata;
    
    % And once you have your result, you should set it up in an output form
    % that AARAE can understand.
    if isstruct(IN)

        OUT.audio = audio; % And modify the fields you processed
        % Or simply output the fields you consider necessary after
        % processing the input audio data, AARAE will figure out what has
        % changed and complete the structure. But remember, it HAS TO BE a
        % structure if you're returning more than one field:
        %   OUT = audio;  if you just want to return the audio,
        %   or,

        % input parameters that could be used to call the function 
        % without dialog box to the output field param (as a cell
        % array) in order to allow batch analysing.
