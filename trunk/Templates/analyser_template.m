function [OUT, varargout] = analyser_template(IN, input_1, input_2, input_3, input_4)
% This function can be used as a template for adapting your audio
% analysing functions to work in the AARAE environment.
%
% AARAE analysers take the audio information stored in the AARAE tree
% display and process the input to produce an output. Unlike generator and
% calculator functions in AARAE, analyser functions require an input in
% the form of a structure type variable (IN) and will output a structure
% type variable with the analysis result (OUT). The input structure will
% ALWAYS have at least the fields .audio, .fs and .datatype that you can
% use to analyse the audio. Analysers may as well include additional
% fields to the output structure in the .properies field (structure type)
%
% You can also use these first few lines to write a brief description of
% what your function does. This will be displayed as a tooltip when the
% user hoovers the mouse over the box where your function is displayed in
% AARAE

    % AARAE has many functions in it, some of which may be particularly
    % useful when writing a processor or analyser. Here are a few examples
    % of potentially useful AARAE functions:
    
    % cal_reset_aarae can be used to simplify the process of applying the
    % calibration offset to your audio. In the following case, gain is
    % applied to the audio waveform such that the cal value is changed to 0
    % dB. The cal_reset_aarae function is in the Processors>Basic folder.
    audio = cal_reset_aarae(audio,0,cal);
    
    % autocropstart_aarae is especially useful for impulse response
    % analysis, when data prior to the impulse response start needs to be
    % cropped (deleted). In the following example, the start of the audio
    % wave that is before the first sample -20 dB below the peak is
    % cropped (as suggested in ISO3382-1). The autocropstart_aarae function
    % is in the Processors>Basic folder.
    audio = autocropstart_aarae(audio,-20,2);
    
    % Aweight, along with similar functions in the Processors>Filters 
    % folder, provides an easy way to implement a weighting filter.
    audio = Aweight(audio,fs);
    
    % octbandfilter_viaFFT is a versatile octave band filterbank. In the
    % example below only the first three input arguments are used, but more
    % can be used if there are particular requirements for the octave band
    % filters' performance. There are other similar functions in the
    % Processors>Filterbanks folder.
    [audio,bandID] = octbandfilter_viaFFT(audio,fs,...
        [125,250,500,1000,2000,4000]);
    
    % You may include tables to display your results using AARAE's
    % disptables.m function - this is just an easy way to display the
    % built-in uitable function in MATLAB. It has several advantages,
    % including:
    %   * automatically sizing the table(s);
    %   * allowing multiple tables to be concatenated;
    %   * allowing concatenated tables to be copied to the clipboard
    %     by clicking on the grey space between the tables in the figure;
    %   * and, if its output is used as described below, returning data to
    %     the AARAE GUI in a format that can be browsed using a bar-plots.
    
    fig1 = figure('Name','My results table');
    table1 = uitable('Data',[duration maximum minimum],...
                'ColumnName',{'Duration','Maximum','Minimum'},...
                'RowName',{'Results'});
    disptables(fig1,table1);
    % You may want to display your tables as barplots in the AARAE
    % environment, in order to do this simply use the output of the
    % disptables funtion as follows:
    %       [~,table] = disptables(fig1,table1);
    % And include your table in the output data structure
    %       OUT.tables = table;
    %
    %
    % If you have multiple tables to combine in the figure, you can
    % concatenate them:
    %       disptables(fig1,[table1 table2 table3]);
    % 
    % You may export these tables to be displayed as bar plots as if you
    % were doing it for a single table:
    %       [~,tables] = disptables(fig1,[table1 table2 table3]);
    %       OUT.tables = tables;
    %
    % The disptables function will take care of allocating each table to a
    % different barplot, there is no need to generate more than one .tables
    % field to display all your tables.
    
    % You may also include figures to display your results as plots.
    t = linspace(0,duration,length(audio));
    figure;
    plot(t,audio);
    % All figures created by your function are stored in the AARAE
    % environment under the results box. If your function outputs a
    % structure in OUT this saved under the 'Results' branch in AARAE and
    % it's treated as an audio signal if it has both .audio and .fs fields,
    % otherwise it's displayed as data.
    % You may want to include your plots as part of the data variable
    % generated by AARAE, in order to do this use the getplotdata function
    % as follows:
    %       OUT.lines.myplot = getplotdata;
    % Use this function for as many charts as you want to include as output
    % from your function. Remember to call the getplotdata function after
    % you have designed your chart. Currently this function only supports
    % barplots and lines. E.g.:
    % 
    %       plot(t,audio)
    %       OUT.lines.thischart = getplotdata;
    
    % And once you have your result, you should set it up in an output form
    % that AARAE can understand.
    if isstruct(IN)
        OUT = IN; % You can replicate the input structure for your output
        OUT.audio = audio; % And modify the fields you processed

        % analysis without user interaction (e.g. for batch processing).

        % input parameters that could be used to call the function 
        % without dialog box to the output field param (as a cell
        % array) in order to allow batch analysing.
