function OUT = calculator_template(input_1, input_2)
% This function can be used as a template for adapting your
% calculator functions to work in the AARAE environment.
%
% As al alternative function header you may use:
%
%function calculator_template(input_1, input_2)
%
% If your calculator doesn't return any variables but only generates plots
% or tables to be displayed.
%
% AARAE calculators require that given that you do require an output of
% your function this output to be given in the form of a structure type
% variable. You may use 'OUT' as the name of your output structure. You can
% design your function to take as many input arguments as you require, but
% usually, since AARAE doesn't allow to input parameters as if you were
% executing the function from MATLAB's Command Window, these parameters are
% requested upon the functions' call in AARAE through an input dialog
% window (See MATLAB help inputdlg). Nonetheless, it's useful to declare
% the input arguments if you'd like your function to be useful as a
% standalone function in MATLAB.
%
% You can also use these first few lines to write a brief description of
% what your function does. This will be displayed as a tooltip when the
% user hoovers the mouse over the box where your function is displayed in
% AARAE
%
% The next few lines show an example on how you may use MATLAB's built-in
% inputdlg function to allow the user to type in the input arguments your
% function requires to work.

if nargin == 0 % If the function is called within the AARAE environment it
               % won't have any input arguments, this is when the inputdlg
               % function becomes useful.

    param = inputdlg({'Input 1';... % These are the input box titles in the
                      'Input 2'},...% inputdlg window.
                      'Window title',... % This is the dialog window title.
                      [1 30],... % You can define the number of rows per
                      ...        % input box and the number of character
                      ...        % spaces that each box can display at once
                      ...        % per row.
                      {'2';'3'}); % And the preset answers for your dialog.

    param = str2num(char(param)); % Since inputs are usually numbers it's a
                                  % good idea to turn strings into numbers.

    if length(param) < 2, param = []; end % You should check that the user 
                                          % has input all the required
                                          % fields.
    if ~isempty(param) % If they have, you can then assign the dialog's
                       % inputs to your function's input parameters.
        input_1 = param(1);
        input_2 = param(2);
    end
else
    param = [];
end

% Normally calculators do not have audio inputs. If you wish to make a
% calculator that has audio input, first think about whether it would be
% better classified as a processor or analyser. If it is really best as a
% calculator, then audio can be input using AARAE's choose_audio function.
% If you wish to do the same with this function outside
% the AARAE environment (as a stand-alone), then it might be easiest to
% have the input audio as an input argument to the function.
if false % change to true if you wish to enable the following
    
    % Use a menu & dialog box to select a wav file or audio within AARAE
    selection = choose_audio; % call AARAE's choose_audio function
    if ~isempty(selection)
        audio = selection.audio; % audio data
        fs = selection.fs; % sampling rate
        [len, chans, bands] = size(audio); % input audio dimensions
    end
end

% To make your function work as standalone you can check that the user has
% either entered some parameters as inputs or that the inputs have been
% acquired through the input dialog window.
if ~isempty(param) || nargin ~= 0
    % If there are some input parameters to work with then your code can be
    % executed! You may copy and paste some code you've written or write
    % something new in the lines below, such as:

    input_sum = input_1 + input_2;
    input_subtract = input_1 - input_2;
    input_multiply = input_1 * input_2;
    input_divide = input_1 / input_2;
    
    % And once you have your result, you should set it up in an output form
    % that AARAE can understand.
    
    if nargin == 0
        OUT.sum = input_sum;
        OUT.subtract = input_subtract;
        OUT.multiply = input_multiply;
        OUT.divide = input_divide;
    end

    % You may include tables to display your results using AARAE's
    % disptables.m function, this is just an easy way to display the
    % built-in uitable function in MATLAB
    f = figure;
    t = uitable('Data',[input_sum input_subtract input_multiply input_divide],...
                'ColumnName',{'+','-','*','/'},...
                'RowName',{'Results'});
    disptables(f,t);
    
    % You may also include figures to display your results as plots.
    f2 = figure;
    plot(peaks)
    % All figures created by your function are stored in the AARAE
    % environment under the results box. If your function outputs a
    % structure in OUT this saved under the 'Results' branch in AARAE and
    % it's treated as an audio signal if it has both .audio and .fs fields,
    % otherwise it's displayed as data.
else
    % AARAE requires that in case that the user doesn't input enough
    % arguments to generate audio to output an empty variable.
    OUT = [];
